### About this conjecture

It is said that the mathematics may not be ready for such problems. Jeffrey Lagarias stated in 2010 that the Collatz conjecture "is an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics". No matter how many times you try, it will always come back to 1.

Rule of the conjecture:
  - If the number is even, divide it by two.
  - If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
  - The integer must be positive.
